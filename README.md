# IoT Dashboard

## Overview

This project is an IoT Dashboard for monitoring and visualizing real-time traffic signal data. It consists of a modern React (TypeScript) frontend and an Express (Node.js) backend. The dashboard fetches traffic signal data (via a proxy API endpoint) and displays metrics (active signals, error states, average duration, and last update) along with a real-time signal chart and signal cards. The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, Drizzle ORM (with PostgreSQL) for database management, and is licensed under the MIT License.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, TanStack Query (React Query), Wouter (routing), Radix UI (components), Lucide React (icons), and more (see package.json).
- **Backend:** Express (Node.js), Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL), drizzle-zod (validation), and (optionally) Passport (authentication).
- **Build & Dev:** Vite, esbuild, TSX, Tailwind, PostCSS, and TypeScript.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node (v 18 or later) and npm (or yarn) installed.
- A PostgreSQL database (or a NeonDB instance) with a valid DATABASE_URL (see drizzle.config.ts).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository (or download the source) and navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harish201105/IoT-Data-Dashboard
     cd IoT-Data-Dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies (using npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) If you're using a local PostgreSQL database, ensure that your DATABASE_URL is set (for example, in a .env file) and run the database migrations (if any) using drizzle-kit:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

4. Start the development server (which serves both the API and the client):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   (This runs "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts" and starts the server on port 5000.)

5. (Optional) To build the project for production, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   (This bundles the client (using Vite) and the server (using esbuild) into the "dist" folder.)

6. (Optional) To start the production server, run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   (This runs "NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js".)

## Usage

- **Development:** Run "npm run dev" to start the dev server (on port 5000). The dashboard is available at "http://localhost:5000".
- **Production:** Build ("npm run build") and then start ("npm start") the production server. (Alternatively, visit the deployed site at [https://iot-data-dashboard.replit.app/](https://iot-data-dashboard.replit.app/).)
- **API Endpoint:** The dashboard fetches real-time traffic signal data via the "/api/iot" endpoint (which proxies an external API). (See "server/routes.ts" and "client/src/lib/api.ts".)

## API Overview

- **GET /api/iot:** Fetches (and logs) traffic signal data (with a fallback if the external API is down). (See "server/routes.ts".)
- (Additional endpoints (e.g., for user management) are defined in "server/routes.ts" and "server/storage.ts".)

## Folder Structure

- **client/** – Frontend (React) code:
  - **client/src/** – React components, pages, hooks, types, and lib (e.g., "client/src/App.tsx", "client/src/pages/Home.tsx", "client/src/components/SignalCards.tsx", "client/src/hooks/useRealTimeData.ts", "client/src/lib/api.ts", "client/src/types/signals.ts", "client/src/pages/not-found.tsx").
  - **client/public/** – Static assets.
  - **client/index.html** – Entry HTML.
- **server/** – Backend (Express) code:
  - **server/index.ts** – Express app entry (sets up middleware, error handling, and starts the server).
  - **server/routes.ts** – API endpoints (e.g., "/api/iot").
  - **server/storage.ts** – (In-memory) storage (or ORM) for user data (using Drizzle ORM).
  - **server/vite.ts** – Vite (dev) integration (for serving the client in development).
- **shared/** – Shared (e.g., database schema) code (e.g., "shared/schema.ts").
- **.config/** – (Optional) configuration files (e.g., "drizzle.config.ts").
- **.gitignore** – (Excludes "node_modules", "dist", ".DS_Store", "server/public", "vite.config.ts.*", "*.tar.gz.".)
- **package.json** – Project metadata, dependencies, and scripts (e.g., "dev", "build", "start", "db:push").
- **package-lock.json** – Lockfile (generated by npm).
- **tsconfig.json** – TypeScript configuration.
- **vite.config.ts** – Vite (client bundler) configuration.
- **tailwind.config.ts** – Tailwind CSS configuration.
- **postcss.config.js** – PostCSS (for Tailwind) configuration.
- **drizzle.config.ts** – Drizzle ORM (database) configuration (requires DATABASE_URL).
