# Contributing to IoT Dashboard

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the IoT Dashboard project! This document outlines a few guidelines to help you get started.

## Steps

1. **Fork (or clone) the repository:**  
   If you haven't already, fork (or clone) the repository so that you can work on your own copy.

2. **Create a new branch:**  
   Create a new branch (for example, "feature/my-feature" or "fix/bug-xyz") so that your changes are isolated.  
   (Example:  
   ```bash
   git checkout â€“b feature/my-feature
   ```)

3. **Make your changes:**  
   Modify (or add) code, tests, or documentation as needed.  
   (Please follow the project's code style (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and linting) and test your changes locally.)

4. **Commit (and push) your branch:**  
   Commit your changes (with a clear commit message) and push your branch to your fork (or origin).

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR):**  
   Open a Pull Request (PR) (from your branch into the main branch) with a clear description of your changes (and, if applicable, a reference to an issue).

## Code Style

- **TypeScript:**  
  Use TypeScript (and follow the project's tsconfig.json) for type safety and clarity.

- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  Use Tailwind CSS (and follow the project's tailwind.config.ts) for styling.

- **Linting:**  
  (If applicable) run a linter (or "npm run check") to ensure that your code adheres to the project's style.
